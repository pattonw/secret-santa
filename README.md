## Capabilities
1) Handle groups. People can be grouped arbitrarily. For example significant others can be grouped and won't be assigned to give each other gifts.
2) Avoid annual repeats. Historical assignments are tracked and repeat assignments are penalized.
3) Avoids pair-wise reciprocation. If person A is assigned to person B, person B won't be assigned to person A.
4) Automatically sends out emails to participants. The organizer does not need to know all the assignments and can participate fairly.
    - requires some additional setup. An email account to send the emails. Configured password, etc.
